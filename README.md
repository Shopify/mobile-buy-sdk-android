## Getting started [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The Buy SDK is built on [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). The SDK handles all the query generation and response parsing, exposing only typed models and compile-time checked query structures. It doesn't require you to write stringed queries, or parse JSON responses.

You don't need to be an expert in GraphQL to start using it with the Buy SDK (but it helps if you've used it before). The sections below provide a brief introduction to this system, and some examples of how you can use it to build secure custom storefronts.

## Migration from SDK v2.0 [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The previous version of the Mobile SDK (version 2.0) is based on a REST API. With version 3.0, Shopify is migrating from REST to GraphQL.

Unfortunately, the specifics of generation GraphQL models make it almost impossible to create a migration path from v2.0 to v3.0 (domains models are not backward compatible). However, the main concepts are the same across the two versions, such as collections, products, checkouts, and orders.

## Code Generation [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The Buy SDK is built on a hierarchy of generated classes that construct and parse GraphQL queries and response. These classes are generated manually by running a custom Ruby script that relies on the [GraphQL Java Generation](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql_java_gen) library. Most of the generation functionality and supporting classes live inside the library. It works by downloading the GraphQL schema, generating Java class hieirarchy, and saving the generated files to the specified folder path. In addition, it provides overrides for custom GraphQL scalar types like `DateTime`.


### Request Models [⤴](#table-of-contents)

All generated request models are represented by interfaces with one method `define` that takes single argument, generated query builder. Every query starts with generated `Storefront.QueryRootQueryDefinition` interface that defines the root of your query.

Let's take a look at an example query for a shop's name:

```java
QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(new Storefront.QueryRootQueryDefinition() {
    @Override public void define(final Storefront.QueryRootQuery rootQueryBuilder) {
      rootQueryBuilder.shop(new Storefront.ShopQueryDefinition() {
        @Override public void define(final Storefront.ShopQuery shopQueryBuilder) {
          shopQueryBuilder.name();
        }
      });
    }
})
```

In this example:

-  `Storefront.query` is the entry point for building GraphQL queries.
-  `Storefront.QueryRootQueryDefinition` represents the root of the query where we ask for the shop's `rootQueryBuilder.shop`.
-  `Storefront.ShopQueryDefinition` represents the subquery definition for shop field, where we request the shop's `shopQueryBuilder.name`.

Request models are generated in such way where lambda expressions can come in handy. We can use lambda expressions to make the initial query more concise:

```java
QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQueryBuilder ->
  rootQueryBuilder
    .shop(shopQueryBuilder ->
      shopQueryBuilder
        .name()
    )
)
```

The code example above produces the following GraphQL query (you can call `query.toString()` to see a built GraphQL query):

```graphql
query {
  shop {
    name
  }
}
```

### Response models [⤴](#table-of-contents)

All generated response models are derived from the `AbstractResponse` type. This abstract class provides a similar key-value type interface to a `Map` for accessing field values in GraphQL responses. You should never use these accessors directly, and instead rely on typed, derived properties in generated subclasses.

Let's continue the example of accessing the result of a shop name query:

```java
// The right way

Storefront.QueryRoot response = ...;

String name = response.getShop().getName();
```

Never use the abstract class directly:

```java
// The wrong way (never do this)

AbstractResponse response = ...;

AbstractResponse shop = (AbstractResponse) response.get("shop");
String name = (String) shop.get("name");
```

Again, both of the approaches produce the same result, but the former case is safe and requires no casting since it already knows about the expected type.

### The `Node` protocol [⤴](#table-of-contents)

GraphQL schema defines a `Node` interface that declares an `id` field on any conforming type. This makes it convenient to query for any object in the schema given only its `id`. The concept is carried across to the Buy SDK as well, but requires a cast to the correct type. You need to make sure that the `Node` type is of the correct type, otherwise casting to an incorrect type will return a runtime exception.

Given this query:

```java
ID id = new ID("NkZmFzZGZhc");
Storefront.query(rootQueryBuilder ->
  rootQueryBuilder
    .node(id, nodeQuery ->
      nodeQuery
        .onProduct(productQuery ->
          productQuery
            .title()
            ...
        )
    )
);
```

The `Storefront.Order` requires a cast:

```java
Storefront.QueryRoot response = ...;

String title = ((Storefront.Product)response.getNode()).getTitle();
```

#### Aliases [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Aliases are useful when a single query requests multiple fields with the same names at the same nesting level, since GraphQL allows only unique field names. Multiple nodes can be queried by using a unique alias for each one:

```java
Storefront.query(rootQueryBuilder ->
  rootQueryBuilder
    .node(new ID("NkZmFzZGZhc"), nodeQuery ->
      nodeQuery
      .onCollection(collectionQuery ->
        collectionQuery
          .withAlias("collection")
          .title()
          .description()
          ...
      )
    )
    .node(new ID("GZhc2Rm"), nodeQuery ->
      nodeQuery
        .onProduct(productQuery ->
          productQuery
            .withAlias("product")
            .title()
            .description()
            ...
        )
    )
);
```

Accessing the aliased nodes is similar to a plain node:

```java
Storefront.QueryRoot response = ...;

Storefront.Collection collection = (Storefront.Collection) response.withAlias("collection").getNode();
Storefront.Product product = (Storefront.Product) response.withAlias("product").getNode();    
```

Learn more about [GraphQL aliases](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases).

## GraphClient [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The `GraphClient` is a network layer built on top of Square's [**OkHttp**](https://github.com/square/okhttp/) client that prepares `GraphCall` to execute `query` and `mutation` requests. It also simplifies polling and retrying requests. To get started with `GraphClient`, you need the following:

- Your shop's `.myshopify.com` domain
- Your API key, which you can find in your shop's admin
- `OkHttpClient` (optional), if you want to customize the configuration used for network requests or share your existing `OkHttpClient` with the `GraphClient`
- Settings for HTTP cache (optional), like the path to the cache folder and maximum allowed size in bytes
- HTTP cache policy (optional), to be used as default for all GraphQL **query** operations (it be ignored for mutation operations, which aren't supported). By default, the HTTP cache policy is set to `NETWORK_ONLY`.

```java
GraphClient.builder(this)
  .shopDomain(BuildConfig.SHOP_DOMAIN)
  .accessToken(BuildConfig.API_KEY)
  .httpClient(httpClient) // optional
  .httpCache(new File(getApplicationContext().getCacheDir(), "/http"), 10 * 1024 * 1024) // 10mb for http cache
  .defaultHttpCachePolicy(HttpCachePolicy.CACHE_FIRST.expireAfter(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES)) // cached response valid by default for 5 minutes
  .build()
```

GraphQL specifies two types of operations: queries and mutations. The `GraphClient` exposes these as two type-safe operations, while also offering some conveniences for retrying and polling in each.

### Queries [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Semantically, a GraphQL `query` operation is equivalent to a `GET` RESTful call. It guarantees that no resources will be mutated on the server. With `GraphClient`, you can perform a query operation using:

```java
GraphClient graphClient = ...;
Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = ...;

QueryGraphCall call = graphClient.queryGraph(query);
```

For example, let's take a look at how we can query for a shop's name:

```java
GraphClient graphClient = ...;

Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQuery ->
  rootQuery
    .shop(shopQuery ->
      shopQuery
        .name()
    )
);

QueryGraphCall call = graphClient.queryGraph(query);

call.enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
    String name = response.data().getShop().getName();
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull GraphError error) {
    Log.e(TAG, "Failed to execute query", error);
  }
});
```

Learn more about [GraphQL queries](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/).

### Mutations [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Semantically a GraphQL `mutation` operation is equivalent to a `PUT`, `POST` or `DELETE` RESTful call. A mutation is almost always accompanied by an input that represents values to be updated and a query to fetch fields of the updated resource. You can think of a `mutation` as a two-step operation where the resource is first modified, and then queried using the provided `query`. The second half of the operation is identical to a regular `query` request.

With `GraphClient`, you can perform a mutation operation using:

```java
GraphClient graphClient = ...;
Storefront.MutationQuery query = ...;

MutationGraphCall call = graphClient.mutateGraph(query);
```

For example, let's take a look at how we can reset a customer's password using a recovery token:

```java
GraphClient graphClient = ...;

Storefront.CustomerResetInput input = new Storefront.CustomerResetInput("c29tZSB0b2tlbiB2YWx1ZQ", "abc123");

Storefront.MutationQuery query = Storefront.mutation(rootQuery ->
  rootQuery
    .customerReset(new ID("YSBjdXN0b21lciBpZA"), input, payloadQuery ->
      payloadQuery
        .customer(customerQuery ->
          customerQuery
            .firstName()
            .lastName()
        )
        .userErrors(userErrorQuery ->
          userErrorQuery
            .field()
            .message()
        )
    )
);

MutationGraphCall call = graphClient.mutateGraph(query);

call.enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.Mutation>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull final GraphResponse<Storefront.Mutation> response) {
    if (response.data().getCustomerReset().getUserErrors().isEmpty()) {
      String firstName = response.data().getCustomerReset().getCustomer().getFirstName();
      String lastName = response.data().getCustomerReset().getCustomer().getLastName();
    } else {
      Log.e(TAG, "Failed to reset customer");
    }
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull final GraphError error) {
    Log.e(TAG, "Failed to execute query", error);
  }
});
```

A mutation will often rely on some kind of user input. Although you should always validate user input before posting a mutation, there are never guarantees when it comes to dynamic data. For this reason, you should always request the `userErrors` field on mutations (where available) to provide useful feedback in your UI regarding any issues that were encountered in the mutation query. These errors can include anything from `Invalid email address` to `Password is too short`.

Learn more about [GraphQL mutations](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

### Retry [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Both `QueryGraphCall` and `MutationGraphCall` have an `enqueue` function that accepts `RetryHandler`. This object encapsulates the retry state and customization parameters for how the `GraphCall` will retry subsequent requests (such as after a delay, or a number of retries).

To enable retry or polling:

1. Create a handler with a condition from one of two factory methods: `RetryHandler.delay(long delay, TimeUnit timeUnit)` or `RetryHandler.exponentialBackoff(long delay, TimeUnit timeUnit, float multiplier)`.
2. Provide an optional retry condition for response `whenResponse(Condition<GraphResponse<T>> retryCondition)` or for error `whenError(Condition<GraphError> retryCondition)`.

If the `retryCondition` evaluates to `true`, then the `GraphCall` will continue to execute the request:

```java
GraphClient graphClient = ...;
Storefront.QueryRootQuery shopNameQuery = ...;

QueryGraphCall call = graphClient.queryGraph(shopNameQuery);

call.enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
    ...
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(GraphError error) {
    ...
  }
}, null, RetryHandler.delay(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
  .maxCount(5)
  .<Storefront.QueryRoot>whenResponse(response -> response.data().getShop().getName().equals("Empty"))
      .build());
}
```

The retry handler is generic, and can handle both `QueryGraphCall` and `MutationGraphCall` requests equally well.

### Caching [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Network queries and mutations can be both slow and expensive. For resources that change infrequently, you might want to use caching to help reduce both bandwidth and latency. Since GraphQL relies on `POST` requests, we can't easily take advantage of the HTTP caching that's available in `OkHttp`. For this reason, the `GraphClient` is equipped with an opt-in caching layer that can be enabled client-wide or on a per-request basis.

**IMPORTANT:** Caching is provided only for `query` operations. It isn't available for `mutation` operations.

There are four available cache policies `HttpCachePolicy`:

- `CACHE_ONLY` - Fetch a response from the cache only, ignoring the network. If the cached response doesn't exist or is expired, then return an error.
- `NETWORK_ONLY` - Fetch a response from the network only, ignoring any cached responses.
- `CACHE_FIRST` - Fetch a response from the cache first. If the response doesn't exist or is expired, then fetch a response from the network.
- `NETWORK_FIRST` - Fetch a response from the network first. If the network fails and the cached response isn't expired, then return cached data instead.

For `CACHE_ONLY`, `CACHE_FIRST` and `NETWORK_FIRST` policies you can define the timeout after what cached response is treated as expired and will be evicted from the http cache, `expireAfter(expireTimeout, timeUnit)`.

#### Enable client-wide caching

You can enable client-wide caching by providing a default `defaultHttpCachePolicy` for any instance of `GraphClient`. This sets all `query` operations to use your default cache policy, unless you specify an alternate policy for an individual request.

In this example, we set the client's `defaultHttpCachePolicy` property to `CACHE_FIRST `:

```java
GraphClient.Builder builder = ...;
builder.defaultHttpCachePolicy(HttpCachePolicy.CACHE_FIRST)
```

Now, all calls to `queryGraph` will yield a `QueryGraphCall` with a `CACHE_FIRST` cache policy.

If you want to override a client-wide cache policy for an individual request, then specify an alternate cache policy as a parameter of `QueryGraphCall`:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;
QueryGraphCall queryCall = client.queryGraph(query)
  .cachePolicy(HttpCachePolicy.NETWORK_FIRST.expireAfter(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
```

In this example, the `queryCall` cache policy changes to `NETWORK_FIRST`, which means that the cached response will be valid for 5 minutes from the time the response is received.


### Errors [⤴](#table-of-contents)

There are two types of errors that you need to handle in the response callback:

* `Error` returns a list of errors inside `GraphResponse`, which represent errors related to GraphQL query itself. These should be used for debugging purposes only.
* `GraphError` represents more critical errors related to the GraphQL query execution and processing response.

#### GraphQL Error [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The `GraphResponse` class represents a GraphQL response for either a `QueryGraphCall` or `MutationGraphCall` request. It can also contain a value for `Error`, which represents the current error state of the GraphQL query.

**It's important to note that `errors` and `data` are NOT mutually exclusive.** That is to say that it's perfectly valid to have a non-null error and data. `Error` will provide more in-depth information about the query error. Keep in mind that these errors are not meant to be displayed to the end-user. **They are for debug purposes only**.

```java
GraphClient graphClient = ...;

QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQueryBuilder ->
  rootQueryBuilder
    .shop(shopQueryBuilder ->
      shopQueryBuilder
        .name()
    )
);

QueryGraphCall call = graphClient.queryGraph(query);
call.enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
  	if (response.hasErrors()) {
     String errorMessage = response.formatErrorMessage();
  	}
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(GraphError error) {

  }
});

```

The following example shows a GraphQL error response:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Field 'Shop' doesn't exist on type 'QueryRoot'",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 90
        }
      ],
      "fields": [
        "Shop"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Learn more about [GraphQL errors](http://graphql.org/learn/validation/)

#### GraphError [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Errors for either a `QueryGraphCall` or `MutationGraphCall` request are defined by the hierarchy of the `GraphError` abstraction, which represents critical errors for query execution. These errors appear in the `GraphCall.Callback#onFailure` callback call. The error codes include:

- `GraphError`: `GraphCall` can't be executed due to an unknown reason
- `GraphCallCanceledError`: `GraphCall` has been canceled
- `GraphHttpError`: `GraphCall` executed but the HTTP response status code is not from the 200 series
- `GraphNetworkError`: `GraphCall` can't be executed due to network issues, such as a timeout or the network being offline
- `GraphParseError`: `GraphCall` executed but parsing JSON response has failed

To handle this type of error:

```java
GraphClient graphClient = ...;
QueryRootQuery query = ...;

QueryGraphCall call = graphClient.queryGraph(query);
call.enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
  	...
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(GraphError error) {
    if (error instanceof GraphCallCanceledError) {
      Log.e(TAG, "Call has been canceled", error);
    } else if (error instanceof GraphHttpError) {
      Log.e(TAG, "Http request failed: " + ((GraphHttpError) error).formatMessage(), error);
    } else if (error instanceof GraphNetworkError) {
      Log.e(TAG, "Network is not available", error);
    } else if (error instanceof GraphParseError) {
      // in most cases should never happen
      Log.e(TAG, "Failed to parse GraphQL response", error);
    } else {
      Log.e(TAG, "Failed to execute GraphQL request", error);
    }
  }
});

```

## Search [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Some `Storefront` models accept search terms via the `query` parameter. For example, you can provide a `query` to search for collections that contain a specific search term in any of their fields.

The following example shows how you can find collections that contain the word "shoes":

```java
Storefront.query(root -> root
  .shop(shop -> shop
    .collections(10, arg -> arg.query("shoes"), connection -> connection
      .edges(edges -> edges
        .node(node -> node
          .title()
          .description()
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

#### Fuzzy matching [⤴](#table-of-contents)

In the example above, the query is `shoes`. This will match collections that contain "shoes" in the description, title, and other fields. This is the simplest form of query. It provides fuzzy matching of search terms on all fields of a collection.

#### Field matching [⤴](#table-of-contents)

As an alternative to object-wide fuzzy matches, you can also specify individual fields to include in your search. For example, if you want to match collections of particular type, you can do so by specifying a field directly:

```java
.collections(10, arg -> arg.query("collection_type:runners"), ...
```

The format for specifying fields and search parameters is the following: `field:search_term`. Note that it's critical that there be no space between the `:` and the `search_term`. Fields that support search are documented in the generated interfaces of the Buy SDK.

**IMPORTANT:** If you specify a field in a search (as in the example above), then the `search_term` will be an **exact match** instead of a fuzzy match. For example, based on the query above, a collection with the type `blue_runners` will not match the query for `runners`.

#### Negating field matching [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Each search field can also be negated. Building on the example above, if you want to match all collections that were **not** of the type `runners`, then you can append a `-` to the relevant field:

```java
.collections(10, arg -> arg.query("-collection_type:runners"), ...
```

#### Boolean operators [⤴](#table-of-contents)

In addition to single field searches, you can build more complex searches using boolean operators. They very much like ordinary SQL operators.

The following example shows how you can search for products that are tagged with `blue` and that are of type `sneaker`:

```java
.products(10, arg -> arg.query("tag:blue AND product_type:sneaker"), ...
```

You can also group search terms:

```java
.products(10, arg -> arg.query("(tag:blue AND product_type:sneaker) OR tag:red"), ...
```

#### Comparison operators [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The search syntax also allows for comparing values that aren't exact matches. For example, you might want to get products that were updated only after a certain a date. You can do that as well:

```java
.products(10, arg -> arg.query("updated_at:>\"2017-05-29T00:00:00Z\""), ...
```

The query above will return products that have been updated after midnight on May 29, 2017. Note how the date is enclosed by another pair of escaped quotations. You can also use this technique for multiple words or sentences.

The SDK supports the following comparison operators:

- `:` equal to
- `:<` less than
- `:>` greater than
- `:<=` less than or equal to
- `:>=` greater than or equal to

**IMPORTANT:** `:=` is not a valid operator.

#### Exists operator [⤴](#table-of-contents)

There is one special operator that can be used for checking `null` or empty values.

The following example shows how you can find products that don't have any tags. You can do so using the `*` operator and negating the field:

```java
.products(10, arg -> arg.query("-tag:*"), ...
```

## Card Vaulting [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The Buy SDK supports native checkout via GraphQL, which lets you complete a checkout with a credit card. However, it doesn't accept credit card numbers directly. Instead, you need to vault the credit cards via the standalone, PCI-compliant web service. The Buy SDK makes it easy to do this using `CardClient`.

### Card Client [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Like `GraphClient`, the `CardClient` manages your interactions with the card server that provides opaque credit card tokens. The tokens are used to complete checkouts. After collecting the user's credit card information in a secure manner, create a credit card representation and submit a vault request:

```java
StoreFront.Checkout checkout = ...;
CardClient cardClient = ...;

CreditCard creditCard = CreditCard.builder()
  .firstName("John")
  .lastName("Smith")
  .number("1")
  .expireMonth("06")
  .expireYear("2017")
  .verificationCode("111")
  .build();

cardClient.vault(creditCard, checkout.getVaultUrl()).enqueue(new CreditCardVaultCall.Callback() {
  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull String token) {
    // proceed to complete checkout with token
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull IOException error) {
        // handle error
  }
});
```
**IMPORTANT:** The credit card vaulting service does **not** provide any validation for submitted credit cards. As a result, submitting invalid credit card numbers or even missing fields will always yield a vault `token`. Any errors related to invalid credit card information will be surfaced only when the provided `token` is used to complete a checkout.

## Android Pay [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Support for Android Pay is provided by the `com.shopify.mobilebuysdk:pay` extension library. It is a separate module from the Buy SDK that offers helper classes for supporting Android Pay in your application. It helps you with the Android Pay workflow by providing convenient helper functions and structures.

Learn more about [Android Pay](https://developers.google.com/android-pay/get-started).

### PayCart [⤴](#table-of-contents)

`PayCart` is a structure that represents a virtual user Android Pay shopping cart by encapsulating all the states necessary for the purchase:

- shop's currency
- merchant's name
- selected product line items
- selected shipping rate
- tax

```java
PayCart payCart = PayCart.builder()
  .merchantName(MERCHANT_NAME)
  .currencyCode(shop.currency)
  .shippingAddressRequired(checkout.requiresShipping)
  .phoneNumberRequired(true)
  .shipsToCountries(Arrays.asList("US", "CA"))
  .addLineItem("Product1", 1, BigDecimal.valueOf(1.99))
  .addLineItem("Product2", 10, BigDecimal.valueOf(3.99))
  .subtotal(checkout.subtotalPrice)
  .totalPrice(checkout.totalPrice)
  .taxPrice(checkout.taxPrice)
  .build();
```

Additionally, `PayCart` provides two functions to help with Masked Wallet and Full Wallet requests:

1. `maskedWalletRequest` to request Masked Wallet information:
  ```java
  MaskedWalletRequest maskedWalletRequest = payCart.maskedWalletRequest(ANDROID_PAY_PUBLIC_KEY);
  ```

2. `fullWalletRequest` to request Full Wallet information:
  ```java
  FullWalletRequest fullWalletRequest = payCart.fullWalletRequest(maskedWallet);
  ```

### PayHelper [⤴](#table-of-contents)

`PayHelper` is a helper class that simplifies interactions with Android Pay. It provides the following helper functions:

- `isAndroidPayEnabledInManifest` checks if Android Pay is enabled
- `isReadyToPay` checks if Android Pay is ready to start purchase flow
- `requestMaskedWallet` requests Masked Wallet information (such as billing address, shipping address, and payment method) from the Android Pay
- `initializeWalletFragment` initializes wallet confirmation `SupportWalletFragment` fragment with obtained Masked Wallet information
- `requestFullWallet` requests Full Wallet information to get payment token and complete checkout
- `newMaskedWallet` requests Masked Wallet information from existing one with new Google Transaction Id. This is useful when a user wants to retry a failed purchase and the current Google Transaction Id is no longer valid.
- `handleWalletResponse` helps to handle Android Pay wallet response by delegation callbacks via `WalletResponseHandler`
- `extractPaymentToken` to extract PaymentToken to complete the checkout

#### Masked Wallet [⤴](#table-of-contents)

To request Masked Wallet information and begin the checkout flow:

1. Check if Android Pay is enabled:
  ```java
  if (PayHelper.isAndroidPayEnabledInManifest(context)) {
  // show Android Pay button
  }
  ```

2. Build `GoogleApiClient` with `Wallet.API` enabled, and connect it:
  ```java
  googleApiClient = new GoogleApiClient.Builder(context)
    .addApi(Wallet.API, new Wallet.WalletOptions.Builder()
      .setEnvironment(ANDROID_PAY_ENVIRONMENT)
      .setTheme(WalletConstants.THEME_DARK)
      .build())
  .addConnectionCallbacks(callback)
  .build();

  ...

  googleApiClient.connect();
  ```

3. Create `PayCart` with all mandatory fields, including the the currency code obtained from `Storefront.Shop`, the Android Pay merchant name, and associated line items (title, price, quantity):
  ```java
  PayCart payCart = PayCart.builder()
    .merchantName(MERCHANT_NAME)
    .currencyCode(shop.currency)
    .shippingAddressRequired(checkout.requiresShipping)
    .phoneNumberRequired(true)
    .shipsToCountries(Arrays.asList("US", "CA"))
    .addLineItem("Product1", 1, BigDecimal.valueOf(1.99))
    .addLineItem("Product2", 10, BigDecimal.valueOf(3.99))
    .subtotal(checkout.subtotalPrice)
    .totalPrice(checkout.totalPrice)
    .taxPrice(checkout.taxPrice)
    .build();
  ```

4. Start the payment flow by requesting Masked Wallet information:
  ```java
  PayHelper.requestMaskedWallet(googleApiClient, payCart, ANDROID_PAY_PUBLIC_KEY);
  ```

After the user authorizes their payment information on the Android Pay screen, `onActivityResult` will be called with returned Masked Wallet information, the Google Transaction ID, and all subsequent change Masked Wallet and Full Wallet requests pertaining to this transaction.

The helper function `handleWalletResponse` helps you with response handling for Masked Wallet requests:

```java
@Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  PayHelper.handleWalletResponse(requestCode, resultCode, data, new PayHelper.WalletResponseHandler() {

    @Override public void onWalletError(int requestCode, int errorCode) {
      // show error, errorCode is one of defined in com.google.android.gms.wallet.WalletConstants
    }

    @Override public void onMaskedWallet(final MaskedWallet maskedWallet) {
      // show order confirmation screen to complete checkout
      // update checkout with shipping address from Masked Wallet
      // fetch shipping rates
    }
  });
}
```

#### Full Wallet [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Masked Wallet information includes the shipping address and billing address, to be used for calculating the exact total purchase price. After the app obtains the Masked Wallet, it should present a confirmation page showing the total cost (`Storefront.Checkout#getTotalPrice`) of the items purchased in the transaction, total taxes (`Storefront.Checkout#getTotalTax`), and an option to select shipping method if the checkout requires shipping (`StoreFront.Checkout#getRequiresShipping`).

When the user confirms the order, Full Wallet information should be requested (`PayHelper#requestFullWallet`) to obtain the payment token required to complete checkout. To request Full Wallet information, you must provide the updated cart with the exact total purchase price and the Masked Wallet that was authorized by the user:

```java
PayHelper.requestFullWallet(googleApiClient, payCart, maskedWallet);
```

After you retrieve the Full Wallet in the `onActivityResult`, you have enough information to proceed to payment processing for this transaction:

```java
@Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  PayHelper.handleWalletResponse(requestCode, resultCode, data, new PayHelper.WalletResponseHandler() {

    @Override public void onWalletError(int requestCode, int errorCode) {
      // show error, errorCode is one of defined in com.google.android.gms.wallet.WalletConstants
    }

    @Override public void onFullWallet(FullWallet fullWallet) {
      PaymentToken paymentToken = PayHelper.extractPaymentToken(fullWallet, ANDROID_PAY_PUBLIC_KEY);
      completeCheckout(paymentToken);
    }
  });
}
```

#### SupportWalletFragment [⤴](#table-of-contents)

In most cases, you will embed the confirmation fragment `SupportWalletFragment` on order confirmation page. This is provided by Android Pay, and it displays buttons that let users optionally modify the masked wallet information (such as the payment method and shipping address). To initialize this fragment properly and to be able use `PayHelper` for handling responses, you should use `PayHelper#initializeWalletFragment`.

The confirmation fragment will notify in `onActivityResult` about any changes that were made by user to their Masked Wallet information (such as changing a shipping address). To handle responses to these changes, you can use the same helper function `PayHelper.handleWalletResponse`:

```java
@Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  PayHelper.handleWalletResponse(requestCode, resultCode, data, new PayHelper.WalletResponseHandler() {

    @Override public void onMaskedWallet(MaskedWallet maskedWallet) {
      // called when user made changes to Masked Wallet inforamtion
      // like shipping address that requires to update checkout to request new shipping rates

      updateMaskedWallet(maskedWallet);
    }
});
```

#### Retry Purchase [⤴](#table-of-contents)

In some cases, a checkout can't be completed with the payment token that was obtained from the Full Wallet information, and you want the user to retry the checkout. As soon as you get Full Wallet information for the specified Masked Wallet, the transaction associated with it is considered complete and can't be used again to request Full Wallet information. To resolve this, you need to start a new transaction by obtaining a Masked Wallet with a new Google Transaction Id. Otherwise, if you try to use it again then you will receive the `WalletConstants.ERROR_CODE_INVALID_TRANSACTION` error.

To request new Masked Wallet information with a new Google Transaction Id associated with it:

```java
PayHelper.newMaskedWallet(googleApiClient, maskedWallet);
```

In other cases, you can receive the `WalletConstants.ERROR_CODE_INVALID_TRANSACTION` error if your payment gateway isn't responding or if you retry a checkout by requesting Full Wallet information while the token is still being processed. This means that the current Google Transaction Id is no longer valid. To continue, you need to start a new transaction by requesting new Masked Wallet information:

```java
@Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  PayHelper.handleWalletResponse(requestCode, resultCode, data, new PayHelper.WalletResponseHandler() {

    @Override public void onMaskedWalletRequest() {
      PayHelper.requestMaskedWallet(googleApiClient, payCart, ANDROID_PAY_PUBLIC_KEY);
    }

    @Override public void onMaskedWallet(MaskedWallet maskedWallet) {
      updateMaskedWallet(maskedWallet);
    }
});
```

## Case studies [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Getting started with any SDK can be confusing. The purpose of this section is to explore all areas of the Buy SDK that may be necessary to build a custom storefront on Android and provide a solid starting point for your own implementation.

In this section we're going to assume that you've [setup a client](#graphclient-) somewhere in your source code. While it's possible to have multiple instances of `GraphClient`, reusing a single instance offers many behind-the-scenes performance improvements.

### Fetch shop [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Before you display products to the user, you typically need to obtain various metadata about your shop. This can be anything from a currency code to your shop's name:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;

...

Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQuery -> rootQuery
  .shop(shopQuery -> shopQuery
    .name()
    .currencyCode()
    .refundPolicy(refundPolicyQuery -> refundPolicyQuery
      .title()
      .url()
    )
  )
);

client.queryGraph(query).enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
    String name = response.data().getShop().getName();
    String currencyCode = response.data().getShop().getCurrencyCode().toString();
    String refundPolicyUrl = response.data().getShop().getRefundPolicy().getUrl();
  }

  ...
});
```

The corresponding GraphQL query would look like this:

```graphql
query {
  shop {
    name
    currencyCode
    refundPolicy {
      title
      url
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetch collections and products [⤴](#table-of-contents)

In our custom storefront, we want to display collection with a preview of several products. With a conventional RESTful service, this would require one network call for collections and another network call for each collection in that array. This is often referred to as the `n + 1` problem.

The Buy SDK is built on GraphQL, which solves the `n + 1` request problem. In the following example, a single query retrieves 10 collection and 10 products for each collection with just one network request:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;

...

Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQuery -> rootQuery
  .shop(shopQuery -> shopQuery
    .collections(10, collectionConnectionQuery -> collectionConnectionQuery
      .edges(collectionEdgeQuery -> collectionEdgeQuery
        .node(collectionQuery -> collectionQuery
          .title()
          .products(10, productConnectionQuery -> productConnectionQuery
            .edges(productEdgeQuery -> productEdgeQuery
              .node(productQuery -> productQuery
                .title()
                .productType()
                .description()
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
);

client.queryGraph(query).enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
    List<Storefront.Collection> collections = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Storefront.CollectionEdge collectionEdge : response.data().getShop().getCollections().getEdges()) {
      collections.add(collectionEdge.getNode());

      List<Storefront.Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
      for (Storefront.ProductEdge productEdge : collectionEdge.getNode().getProducts().getEdges()) {
        products.add(productEdge.getNode());
      }
    }
  }

  ...
});
```

The corresponding GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql
{
  shop {
    collections(first: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          products(first: 10) {
            edges {
              node {
                id
                title
                productType
                description
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Since it retrieves only a small subset of properties for each resource, this GraphQL request is also much more bandwidth-efficient than it would be to fetch 100 complete resources via conventional REST.

But what if you need to get more than 10 products in each collection?

### Pagination [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Although it might be convenient to assume that a single network request will suffice for loading all collections and products, in many cases a single request . The best practice is to paginate results. Since the Buy SDK is built on top of GraphQL, it inherits the concept of `edges` and `nodes`.

Learn more about [pagination in GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/pagination/).

Let's take a look at how we can paginate through products in a collection:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;

...

Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQuery -> rootQuery
  .node(new ID("IjoxNDg4MTc3MzEsImxhc3R"), nodeQuery -> nodeQuery
    .onCollection(collectionQuery -> collectionQuery
      .products(10, args -> args.after(productPageCursor), productConnectionQuery -> productConnectionQuery
        .pageInfo(pageInfoQuery -> pageInfoQuery
          .hasNextPage()
        )
        .edges(productEdgeQuery -> productEdgeQuery
          .cursor()
          .node(productQuery -> productQuery
            .title()
            .productType()
            .description()
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
);

client.queryGraph(query).enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
    Storefront.Collection collection = (Storefront.Collection) response.data().getNode();
    boolean hasNextProductPage = collection.getProducts().getPageInfo().getHasNextPage();
    List<Storefront.Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Storefront.ProductEdge productEdge : collection.getProducts().getEdges()) {
      String productPageCursor = productEdge.getCursor();
      products.add(productEdge.getNode());
    }
  }

  ...
});
```

The corresponding GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql
query {
  node(id: "IjoxNDg4MTc3MzEsImxhc3R") {
    ... on Collection {
      products(first: 10, after: "sdWUiOiIxNDg4MTc3M") {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            title
            productType
            description
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Since we know exactly what collection we want to fetch products for, we'll use the [`node` interface](#the-node-protocol-) to query the collection by `id`. You might notice that we're fetching a couple of additional fields and objects: `pageInfo` and `cursor`. We can then use a `cursor` of any product edge to fetch more products `before` it or `after` it. Likewise, the `pageInfo` object provides additional metadata about whether the next page (and potentially previous page) is available or not.

### Fetch product details [⤴](#table-of-contents)

In our sample app we likely want to have a detailed product page with images, variants, and descriptions. Conventionally, we'd need multiple `REST` calls to fetch all the required information. But with Buy SDK, we can do it with a single query:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;

Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQuery -> rootQuery
  .node(new ID("9Qcm9kdWN0LzMzMj"), nodeQuery -> nodeQuery
    .onProduct(productQuery -> productQuery
      .title()
      .description()
      .images(10, imageConnectionQuery -> imageConnectionQuery
        .edges(imageEdgeQuery -> imageEdgeQuery
          .node(imageQuery -> imageQuery
            .src()
          )
        )
      )
      .variants(10, variantConnectionQuery -> variantConnectionQuery
        .edges(variantEdgeQuery -> variantEdgeQuery
          .node(productVariantQuery -> productVariantQuery
            .price()
            .title()
            .available()
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
);

client.queryGraph(query).enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {

  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
    Storefront.Product product = (Storefront.Product) response.data().getNode();
    List<Storefront.Image> productImages = new ArrayList<>();
    for (final Storefront.ImageEdge imageEdge : product.getImages().getEdges()) {
      productImages.add(imageEdge.getNode());
    }
    List<Storefront.ProductVariant> productVariants = new ArrayList<>();
    for (final Storefront.ProductVariantEdge productVariantEdge : product.getVariants().getEdges()) {
      productVariants.add(productVariantEdge.getNode());
    }
  }

  ...
});
```

The corresponding GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql
{
  node(id: "9Qcm9kdWN0LzMzMj") {
    ... on Product {
      id
      title
      description
      images(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            src
          }
        }
      }
      variants(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            price
            title
            available
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Checkout [⤴](#table-of-contents)

After browsing products and collections, a customer might eventually want to purchase something. The Buy SDK does not provide support for a local shopping cart since the requirements can vary between applications. Instead, the implementation is left up to the custom storefront. Nevertheless, when a customer is ready to make a purchase you'll need to create a checkout.

Almost every `mutation` query requires an input object. This is the object that dictates what fields will be mutated for a particular resource. In this case, we'll need to create a `Storefront.CheckoutCreateInput`:

```java
Storefront.CheckoutCreateInput input = new Storefront.CheckoutCreateInput()
  .setLineItems(Arrays.asList(
    new Storefront.CheckoutLineItemInput(new ID("mFyaWFu"), 5),
    new Storefront.CheckoutLineItemInput(new ID("8vc2hGl"), 3)
  ));
```

The checkout input object accepts other arguments like `email` and `shippingAddress`. In our example we don't have access to that information from the customer until a later time, so we won't include them in this mutation. Given the checkout input, we can execute the `checkoutCreate` mutation:

```java
Storefront.MutationQuery query = Storefront.mutation(mutationQuery -> mutationQuery
  .checkoutCreate(input, createPayloadQuery -> createPayloadQuery
    .checkout(checkoutQuery -> checkoutQuery
      .webUrl()
    )
    .userErrors(userErrorQuery -> userErrorQuery
      .field()
      .message()
    )
  )
);

client.mutateGraph(query).enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.Mutation>() {
  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull GraphResponse<Storefront.Mutation> response) {
    if (!response.data().getCheckoutCreate().getUserErrors().isEmpty()) {
      // handle user friendly errors
    } else {
      String checkoutId = response.data().getCheckoutCreate().getCheckout().getId().toString();
      String checkoutWebUrl = response.data().getCheckoutCreate().getCheckout().getWebUrl();
    }
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull GraphError error) {
    // handle errors
  }
});
```

**It is best practice to always include `userErrors` fields in your mutation payload query, where possible.** You should always validate user input before making mutation requests, but it's possible that a validated user input might cause a mismatch between the client and server. In this case, `userErrors` contains an error with a `field` and `message` for any invalid or missing fields.

Since we'll need to update the checkout with additional information later, all we need from a checkout in this mutation is an `id` so we can keep a reference to it. We can skip all other fields on `Storefront.Checkout` for efficiency and reduced bandwidth.

#### Updating a checkout [⤴](#table-of-contents)

A customer's information may not be available when a checkout is created. The Buy SDK provides mutations for updating specific checkout fields that are required for completion: the `email` and `shippingAddress` fields.

###### Updating email [⤴](#table-of-contents)

```java
ID checkoutId = ...;

Storefront.MutationQuery query = Storefront.mutation(mutationQuery -> mutationQuery
  .checkoutEmailUpdate(checkoutId, "john.smith@gmail.com", emailUpdatePayloadQuery -> emailUpdatePayloadQuery
    .checkout(checkoutQuery -> checkoutQuery
      .webUrl()
    )
    .userErrors(userErrorQuery -> userErrorQuery
      .field()
      .message()
    )
  )
);
```

###### Updating shipping address [⤴](#table-of-contents)

```java
PayAddress address = ...;

Storefront.MailingAddressInput input = new Storefront.MailingAddressInput()
  .setAddress1(address.address1)
  .setAddress2(address.address2)
  .setCity(address.city)
  .setCountry(address.country)
  .setFirstName(address.firstName)
  .setLastName(address.lastName)
  .setPhone(address.phone)
  .setProvince(address.province)
  .setZip(address.zip);

Storefront.Mutation query = Storefront.mutation((mutationQuery -> mutationQuery
    .checkoutShippingAddressUpdate(input, checkoutId, shippingAddressUpdatePayloadQuery -> shippingAddressUpdatePayloadQuery
      .checkout(checkoutQuery -> checkoutQuery
        .webUrl()
      )
      .userErrors(userErrorQuery -> userErrorQuery
        .field()
        .message()
      )
    )
  )
);
```

#### Polling for shipping rates [⤴](#table-of-contents)

Available shipping rates are specific to a checkout since the cost to ship items depends on the quantity, weight, and other attributes of the items in the checkout. Shipping rates also require a checkout to have a valid `shippingAddress`, which can be updated using steps found in [updating a checkout](#updating-a-checkout-). Available shipping rates are a field on `Storefront.Checkout`, so given a `checkoutId` (that we kept a reference to earlier) we can query for shipping rates:

```java
ID checkoutId = ...;

Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQuery -> rootQuery
  .node(checkoutId, nodeQuery -> nodeQuery
    .onCheckout(checkoutQuery -> checkoutQuery
      .availableShippingRates(availableShippingRatesQuery -> availableShippingRatesQuery
        .ready()
        .shippingRates(shippingRateQuery -> shippingRateQuery
          .handle()
          .price()
          .title()
        )
      )
    )
  )
);
```

The query above starts an asynchoronous task on the server to fetch shipping rates from multiple shipping providers. Although the request might return immediately (network latency aside), it does not mean that the list of shipping rates is complete. This is indicated by the `ready` field in the query above. It is your application's responsibility to continue retrying this query until `ready == true`. The Buy SDK has [built-in support for retrying requests](#retry-), so we'll create a retry handler and perform the query:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;
Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = ...;
...

client.queryGraph(query).enqueue(
      new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {
        @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull final GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
          Storefront.Checkout checkout = (Storefront.Checkout) response.data().getNode();
          List<Storefront.ShippingRate> shippingRates = checkout.getAvailableShippingRates().getShippingRates();
        }

        @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull final GraphError error) {
        }
      },
      null,
      RetryHandler.exponentialBackoff(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, 1.2f)
        .whenResponse(
          response -> ((Storefront.Checkout) response.data().getNode()).getAvailableShippingRates().getReady() == false
        )
        .maxCount(10)
        .build()
    );
```

The callback `onResponse` will be called only if `availableShippingRates.ready == true` or the retry count reaches 10.

#### Completing a checkout [⤴](#table-of-contents)

After all required fields have been filled and the customer is ready to pay, you have three ways to complete the checkout and process the payment:

- [Web](#web-checkout-)
- [Credit card](#credit-card-checkout-)

##### Web checkout [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The simplest way to complete a checkout is by redirecting the customer to a web view where they will be presented with the same flow that they're familiar with on the web. The `Storefront.Checkout` resource provides a `webUrl` that you can use to present a web view.

**NOTE**: Although using web checkout is the simplest out of the three approaches, it can make it difficult to observe the checkout state. Since the web view doesn't provide any callbacks for various checkout states, you still need to [poll for checkout completion](#polling-for-checkout-completion-).

##### Credit card checkout [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The native credit card checkout offers the most conventional UX out of the three alternatives but is also requires the most effort to implement. You'll be required to implement UI for gathering your customers' name, email, address, payment information, and other fields required to complete checkout.

Assuming your custom storefront has all the information it needs, the first step to completing a credit card checkout is to vault the provided credit card and exchange it for a payment token that will be used to complete the payment. Please reference the instructions for [vaulting a credit card](#card-vaulting-).

After obtaining a credit card vault token, we can proceed to complete the checkout by creating a `CreditCardPaymentInput` and executing the mutation query:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;
ID checkoutId = ...;
BigDecimal amount = ...;
String idempotencyKey = ...;
Storefront.MailingAddressInput billingAddress = ...;
String creditCardVaultToken = ...;

Storefront.CreditCardPaymentInput input = new Storefront.CreditCardPaymentInput(amount, idempotencyKey, billingAddress,
      creditCardVaultToken);

Storefront.MutationQuery query = Storefront.mutation(mutationQuery -> mutationQuery
  .checkoutCompleteWithCreditCard(checkoutId, input, payloadQuery -> payloadQuery
    .payment(paymentQuery -> paymentQuery
      .ready()
      .errorMessage()
    )
    .checkout(checkoutQuery -> checkoutQuery
      .ready()
    )
    .userErrors(userErrorQuery -> userErrorQuery
      .field()
      .message()
    )
  )
);

client.mutateGraph(query).enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.Mutation>() {
  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull final GraphResponse<Storefront.Mutation> response) {
    if (!response.data().getCheckoutCompleteWithCreditCard().getUserErrors().isEmpty()) {
      // handle user friendly errors
    } else {
      boolean checkoutReady = response.data().getCheckoutCompleteWithCreditCard().getCheckout().getReady();
      boolean paymentReady = response.data().getCheckoutCompleteWithCreditCard().getPayment().getReady();
    }
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull final GraphError error) {
    // handle errors
  }
});
```

##### Android Pay checkout [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The Buy SDK makes Android Pay integration easy with the provided `android-pay` module. Refer to the [Android Pay](#android-pay-) section on how to helper classes and obtain a payment token. With token in-hand, we can complete the checkout:

```java
GraphClient client = ...;
ID checkoutId = ...;
PaymentToken paymentToken = ...;
PayAddress billingAddress = ...;
PayCart payCart = ...;
String idempotencyKey = ...;

Storefront.MailingAddressInput mailingAddressInput = new Storefront.MailingAddressInput()
  .setAddress1(billingAddress.address1)
  .setAddress2(billingAddress.address2)
  .setCity(billingAddress.city)
  .setCountry(billingAddress.country)
  .setFirstName(billingAddress.firstName)
  .setLastName(billingAddress.lastName)
  .setPhone(billingAddress.phone)
  .setProvince(billingAddress.province)
  .setZip(billingAddress.zip);

Storefront.TokenizedPaymentInput input = new Storefront.TokenizedPaymentInput(payCart.totalPrice, idempotencyKey,
  mailingAddressInput, paymentToken.token, "android_pay").setIdentifier(paymentToken.publicKeyHash);

Storefront.MutationQuery query = Storefront.mutation(mutationQuery -> mutationQuery
  .checkoutCompleteWithTokenizedPayment(checkoutId, input, payloadQuery -> payloadQuery
    .payment(paymentQuery -> paymentQuery
      .ready()
      .errorMessage()
    )
    .checkout(checkoutQuery -> checkoutQuery
      .ready()
    )
    .userErrors(userErrorQuery -> userErrorQuery
      .field()
      .message()
    )
  )
);

client.mutateGraph(query).enqueue(new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.Mutation>() {
  @Override public void onResponse(@NonNull final GraphResponse<Storefront.Mutation> response) {
    if (!response.data().getCheckoutCompleteWithCreditCard().getUserErrors().isEmpty()) {
      // handle user friendly errors
    } else {
      boolean checkoutReady = response.data().getCheckoutCompleteWithCreditCard().getCheckout().getReady();
      boolean paymentReady = response.data().getCheckoutCompleteWithCreditCard().getPayment().getReady();
    }
  }

  @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull final GraphError error) {
    // handle errors
  }
});
```

#### Polling for checkout completion [⤴](#table-of-contents)

After a successful `checkoutCompleteWith...` mutation, the checkout process starts. This process is usually short, but it isn't immediate. Because of this, polling is required to obtain an updated checkout in a `ready` state - with a `Storefront.Order`.

```java
GraphClient client = ...;
ID checkoutId = ...;

Storefront.QueryRootQuery query = Storefront.query(rootQuery -> rootQuery
  .node(checkoutId, nodeQuery -> nodeQuery
    .onCheckout(checkoutQuery -> checkoutQuery
      .order(orderQuery -> orderQuery
        .createdAt()
        .orderNumber()
        .totalPrice()
      )
    )
  )
);

client.queryGraph(query).enqueue(
  new GraphCall.Callback<Storefront.QueryRoot>() {
	@Override public void onResponse(@NonNull GraphResponse<Storefront.QueryRoot> response) {
      Storefront.Checkout checkout = (Storefront.Checkout) response.data().getNode();
      String orderId = checkout.getOrder().getId().toString();
    }

    @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull GraphError error) {
    }
  },
  null,
  RetryHandler.exponentialBackoff(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, 1.2f)
    .whenResponse(
      response -> ((Storefront.Checkout) response.data().getNode()).getOrder() == null
    )
    .maxCount(10)
    .build()
);
```

Again, just like when [polling for available shipping rates](#polling-for-shipping-rates-), we need to create a `RetryHandler` to provide a condition upon which to retry the request. In this case, we're asserting that the `Storefront.Order` is `null` an continue retrying the request if it is.

## Sample application [⤴](#table-of-contents)

The Buy SDK includes a comprehensive sample application that covers the SDK's most common use cases. It's built on best practices and our recommended `ViewModel` architecture. You can use it as a template, a starting point, or a place to cherrypick components as needed. Check out the [Sample readme](/MobileBuy/sample/) for more details.
